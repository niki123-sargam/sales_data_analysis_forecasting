Retail businesses generate large volumes of sales data, but raw data alone does not provide actionable insights. Without proper analysis, businesses struggle to:
- Identify top-performing regions
- Understand seasonal sales patterns
- Predict future demand
- Plan inventory and marketing strategies

This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw sales data into interactive dashboards and predictive insights.
